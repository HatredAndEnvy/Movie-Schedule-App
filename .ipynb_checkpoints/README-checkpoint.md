    This is the 'raw' excel file I received a few weeks into discussions.  It is a great example of a document one might receive from a non-analysis for a project.

    It explains the app plan, layout, and expectations for the assignment.

See 'Movie Project.docx' for further details.


Jerry's notes:
I originally wrote this while learning python.  Unfortunately, I did not follow pep-8 very well.  Sorry.
The solver takes an unreasonably long time to find the optimal solution.  So, a time limit is imposed to (hopefully) return a reasonable solution.  I think it would be easier to implement a heuristic approach (than optimizing the problem in its current formulation).
